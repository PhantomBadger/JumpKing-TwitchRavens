# Jump King Chat Raven Mod
This Mod allows your Twitch or YouTube Chat to lend words of encouragement whilst you climb to the babe! It will also include the 'Fall Damage' mod until we can get around to splitting it out properly.

## Features
### Twitch & YouTube Ravens
Both Twitch and YouTube Chat can now communicate with you within the world of Jump King! Messages from chat will be parroted by small ravens that land on the stage as you traverse it. You have the option of gating this behind a Channel Point reward for busier chats!

</p>

The Ravens can be triggered through different ways to suit your chat
- **Chat Message:** Spawns a Raven for every Chat Message that appears
- **Channel Point:** Spawns a Raven when a chatter redeems a specified Channel Point (Uses the text from that channel point!) *(Twitch Only)*
- **Insult:** Spawns Ravens when you fall, they choose from a pre-determined list of insults *(Twitch Only)*

### Gun Mode
Are your chat ravens dunking on you a bit _too_ hard for that last fall? Use the mouse-controlled Ravens Gun to blast them out of the sky and take out some of your rage!

</p>

### Free Flying
Toggle a 'free flying' mode for the Jump King, which will let you explore or practice jumps without consequence!

_**Note:** Enabling this aspect of the mod will disable achievements in the game until the Free Flying mod is turned off in the settings!_

# Chaos Mode/Modifiers

## Features
### Fall Damage
The King is no longer the resilient hero he once was, each fall takes a bit more of his health away - until you're forced to try again from the start!
